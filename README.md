# waifu-classifier

`waifu-classifier` is a simple machine learning model that looks at an image of your waifu (as long as she's [Rei Ayanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rei_Ayanami) or [Asuka Langley Soryu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_Langley_Soryu)), recognizes it, and rates her in an objective, non-opionated fashion.

(This is my attempt at working through the material in <fast.ai>'s [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course, but who cares about _that_?)
