`waifu-classifier` is a simple machine learning model that looks at an image of your waifu (as long as she's [Rei Ayanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rei_Ayanami) or [Asuka Langley Soryu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_Langley_Soryu)), recognizes it, and rates her in an objective, non-opionated fashion. You can play with the model on your browser [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/guillecosta/waifu-classifier/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fapp.ipynb).

(This is my attempt at working through the material in [fast.ai](https://fast.ai)'s [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course, but who cares about _that_?)
